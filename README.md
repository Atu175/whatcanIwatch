## Description/Motivation
 A movie website that suggest movies to the user based on a certain criterial and then tells them were to watch that movie. Also, it provides a place to blog about the movie 
## Scope 
In this project, I amm planning to build a website that gives suggestions to users on the type of movies to watch base off of certain categories. At the end, you can talk blog about the movies you watched 
## Vision
I want this website to be a place where users can relate with people on their blogs according to the type of movies the like. Also, I want people not too waste time scrolling on streaming apps looking for movies that might not be there but instead get cool recommendations on my website.
