## Concept Proposal
## Project Name
- I have decided to call the project **whatcaniwatch**
## Goals
- This will be a movie website that gives users the chance to look for movies and watch on streaming websites
- What  this movie site offers that is different from others is the ability for users to write a short blog about the movie so people can look at. The goal of this blog is  to draw other people's attention to the movies you've watched
## Context
- This website will be like other streaming websites like Netflix, Hulu to list a few but users won't be able to stream on it 
## Novelty
- 
## Functionality
- blogging site: Allow users to write blogs
- movie sites: allow users to filter movies based off of popular genres
- 
## Audience
- This project is created for anyone with access to the internet 
## Challenges
- During this project, my challenges will be my limited knowledge on some of the technology I will be using like Django, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
## Measures
- Right now, I will measure by making sure I have created all the basic parts like the movie page and the blogging page and they are able to work together
## Motivation
- Firsty, I want to finish this projects so I can be able to graduate an have something really fun on my resume to show future employers
- Secondly, I am a very big fan of movies. It is very hard going to netflix and other streaming sites to search for movies. With this project, I have a chance see every movie out there and see comments people have said about that movie.
## Future Extensions
- I want to be able to let users interact on others blogs through writing comments
- I want to give people a chance to rate each movie
## Other (Optional)
- N/A
