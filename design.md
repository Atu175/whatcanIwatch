## a simplified description of the entire planned project system which abstracts the essentials and ignores the non-essentials;
      This website recommends movies to people based on which criteria they choose like romance, under $5, classic, to list a few. I will get this movies by scrapping the web and getting movies from different websites
## defines the major software components (classes, methods, etc);
      I will be building a website so, I will be using flask, bootstrap, beautiful soup for scraping, and an API
## uses a hierarchical presentation which makes the system simple to understand;
      This will be a website so each click will take you to a different page that gives you the recommended movies or description of the movies
       
## shows the flow of control and data through the system;
      It will start with a homepage that asks the user to either login or sign up, then it takes you to the recommended or you might decide to blog  about a movie you already watch
## is organized according to consistent conventions;
      
## can be used for reasoning about the software system.
